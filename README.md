# Hey there, I'm Harsh 👋

I'm a Full Stack Developer with a passion for creating innovative solutions to complex problems. When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new cuisines, playing volleyball, or binge-watching anime.

## What am I working on? - [Memnook.com](https://memnook.com)

[Memnook.com](https://memnook.com) is a start-up project I am working on to help students study notes more effectively. The web application takes a user's notes and converts them into flashcards, making it easy for students to study on-the-go.

### Features 🚀

* Convert notes into flashcards
* Intuitive and easy-to-use interface
* Multiple study modes
* Mobile-responsive design
* Customizable flashcard settings (Coming Soon)

### Tech Stack 💻

* Front-end: TypeScript, React, Next.js, TailwindCSS
* Back-end: Next.JS, trpc.io, Prisma, MySQL
* Tools: Git/GitHub, Figma, Visual Studio Code, Postman
* Hosting: Vercel (as website hosting and CI/CD), PlanetScale (Serverless MySQL hosting)

### Demo 🔍

The application is currently in closed preview. If you're interested in seeing a demo, please contact me for access on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/harsh_p_patel).

### Feedback 🙏

I am always looking for ways to improve the application and make it more useful for students. If you have any feedback or suggestions, please contact me directly on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/harsh_p_patel).
